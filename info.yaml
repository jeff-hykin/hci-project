        - have the magic bar be 48 hours long
        - have every event in the bar be absolutely positioned based on their 24-hour time
        - have the magic-bar-offset assume that the magic-box starts at 12am
          and then shift it left to match the current time
        - on page load, set the magic bar offset to change with the current time
        - on click of an event, set the magic bar offset to be the start time of that event
