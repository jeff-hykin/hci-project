            - have every event in the bar be absolutely positioned based on their 24-hour time
            - have the magic-bar-offset assume that the magic-box starts at 12am
              and then shift it left to match the current time
            - on page load, set the magic bar offset to change with the current time
            - on click of an event, set the magic bar offset to be the start time of that event
            - have the weather basically be a special kind of event
            - have a magic-bar-width value that propogates to every event and weather to change the zoom level

            - update countdown
            - if currentEvent is in the past, remove it from the future events list
            - if selected event == null then have cursor = current time
            - else have cursor = start time of event
            
        - on select event:
            - if selected event is the first future event, set selected event to null
            - else assign the selected event
        
        - event preview:
